                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I am James Bressani and an Information Science student with a concentration in Data Science and Analytics at the University of South Florida (USF). Growing up, technology has always been a large fascination of mine, from my dad working at Boeing to always messing with the new technologies as soon as I got a hold of them. I knew that I wanted to work with making new innovations and that led me to pursuing this field.
</p>
                    
                    <p>When in grade school, I got to experience working with different programs such as Scratch, Photoshop, HTML, and a robotics course. I really enjoyed the design aspect of those programs and would always find myself tinkering in Photoshop and soon would go into video editing. The design process has taught me many things such as the process of failure and success. Many designs are not made on the first try, but are revised over a course of time. Learning from the design process has helped shape many of the skills I have today. Working with these programs also led me to my interest in building computers. This hobby would soon be the rationale for how I chose my major.
</p>
                    
                    <p>My journey at USF taught me many different skills. Object oriented programming (OOP) is the most important skill I believe I have received. There are many ways to relate OOP logic to real life, but OOP is helpful in many fields such as data science, software engineering, IT, cloud engineering, and cybersecurity. I believed I had the skills to do any of the fields, so I started applying to many internships in the different fields.
</p>
<p>During my senior year, my first internship was at SOFWERX as a System Administration Intern. My time at SOFWERX would give me a different perspective of IT after working there. One of the projects I developed during my time there was a web portal using Django and Python. This web portal would centralize the tools that were needed for basic system administration. I also got to experience the side of a system admin that was closer to the help desk side. Some of my days were spent resetting passwords or onboarding new employees. There were many opportunities to learn at SOFWERX and it helped shape my career and curiosity of what field I wanted to pursue in IT.
</p>
<p>My latest internship was as an IT Intern at DTCC. It was a different experience from SOFWERX as I was working front-end development on a large team. I joined a project that would migrate a web application to a new technology stack. I primarily worked with the interface with Angular which communicated with the Spring Boot back-end. This experience honed my programming skills and leveraged my best skills in design. The internship also gave me experience working in an agile environment where the process is iterative. My previous classes in photoshop taught me that designs are never finalized at the start, and it helped me keep up with the process of working on something and having to scrap or change things.
</p>
<p>Outside of school and work I have hobbies that are similar. I have a drone that can capture footage, a digital camera for photography, play the piano, and I am a Seahawks fan. Inside of these hobbies, I also love to leverage numbers and look for patterns.
</p>
<p>As I approach graduation, I am happy to announce that I accepted a returning role into DTCCâ€™s Edge Program where I get to rotate through different roles and hone my skills. I hope to find my niche during this time and become the best I can at it. I look forward to working with different technologies in an enterprise environment and specifically want to learn about cloud technologies and web development.</p>
